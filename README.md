What is cReComp?
===============================
The cReComp is a **automatic design environment for componentization of a single hardware or the multiple hardware**. The component generated by the cReComp is HW/SW co-system that is connected between CPU and FPGA (reconfigurable hw). The cReComp is possible to debug and test single hardware with software in a user development fase. When the development of a each hardware have been finished, the cReComp generates as one of the HW/SW system by integrating the each of the hardware.

Update
=================================
